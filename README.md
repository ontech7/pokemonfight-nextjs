## Game rules

You must create a team of six pokemons, and the team must have a name as well.

After that, the route **TEAM FIGHTING** will be enabled on the homepage.

By clicking that, you will be transported to the `/team/fight` route, showing the summary of the two teams.

The button **THE BATTLE BEGINS** will start a Pokemon battle between your team and a randomly generated team, for the other side.

The team with more base experience will win the match.
